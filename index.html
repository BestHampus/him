        <h2>About Bosse</h2>
        <p>He is a very s̶w̶e̶e̶t  harsh with his words sometimes, and sometimes it hurt me.</p>
        <p>Even though I love him, I wish he was nicer.</p>
        <p>If he was nicer, he would be better then any of the partners I've had before him.</p>
        <!--Bosse, if you ever inspect the code again!-->
        <!--Could you be a little nicer to me and stop be rude to me!-->
        <!--I might laugh at it, but on the inside it hurt me a lot!-->
        <!--If you stop be rude to me I won't be rude to you, I swer!-->
        <!--I'm serious, please don't be rude to me, okay?!-->
